      Welcome to the VCA4D website. You will find a tailored access to 35 value chain analyses
      across 16 different agricultural commodities around the world. Based on a standardised
      methodology (*link), each analysis allows an assessment of the value chain's impact on
      smallholders, businesses, society and environment. Any of the VCA4D academic study provides
      information across 4 related domains:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>the various actors and structuration of the chain</li>
      <li>its contribution to economic growth and the state's public finance</li>
      <li>the chain's inclusiveness and contribution to employment</li>
      <li>the impact of the value chain on environment.</li>
